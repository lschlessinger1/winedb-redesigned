The wine database project is a way to organize wines.
There will be QR codes on each wine, custom printed with unique ids provided by Zebra's software.
I will be able to sequence each QR code on the software and then print the self-adhesive labels for each bottle.
After this, I will create an application for the IOS that can connect to the database that I create with the wines
and be able to view information with it and delete it from the database. This will be done mainly with PhoneGap.

this will just be a heatmap of the wine locations.
i will use google's API with XML to see where in the world the wines were purchased and made

other ideas:
maybe filter the heatmap by country or something like it
could calculate interesting stuff like where a user buys the most wines
if a user has multiple homes, they could track where the specific bottles are in the world

questions:
will I need to put lat and lon for locations table
how much info will wine.com API give me?
what will it be a heatmap of, wine_make_or_vineyard , country, region etc.? Or can the user select these options?
